Translating Swift
-----------------
Below, you will find instructions on how to translate Swift. A prerequisite is to
have Qt (with Qt Linguist installed).


Starting a new translation
--------------------------
- Run the following command to generate a clean translation template 'swift.ts':
    scons update_translations=1 Swift/Translations/swift.ts
- Rename the new 'swift.ts' file to swift_<LANGUAGE-CODE>.ts, e.g. "swift_nl.ts"
  for Dutch
- Open the file in Qt Linguist, and translate the phrases. 
  For more information, see http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/linguist-manual.html
- Translate the Swift/resources/swift.desktop entry.
- Submit your finished translation file to the Swift development team.

If you have trouble generating the translation file yourself, you can ask the 
Swift development team to provide you with a new translation template for your 
language.


Updating an existing translation
--------------------------------
- Run the following command to update an existing translation template:
    scons update_translations=1 Swift/Translations/<your-translation-file>

If you have trouble updating the translation file yourself, you can ask the 
Swift development team to provide you with a new translation template for your 
language.


Testing your translation
------------------------
- Ensure your translation file is in Swift/Translations/swift_<YOURLANGUAGE>.ts
- Build Swift (for more details, see the building documentation):
    scons Swift
  This will build translation modules (.qm) for your translation sources, and 
  put them in the right place.
- Run Swift
