Prerquisites
------------
- MinGW
  * Install the self-extracting executable package from
    http://mingw.org
  * 
- MSYS
  * Install the self-extracting executable package
    http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys
- autoconf/automake (Only required when building from the Git tree)
  * These packages are included in msysDTK, but are too old.
  * To compile autoconf/automake, first install either msysdtk, or the m4, crypt and perl packages for msys.
  * Download & extract the latest packages from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/
    and http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake
  * Configure the packages with 
      ./configure --prefix=/mingw
  * Run 'make' and 'make install'
- OpenSSL
  * Download and extract the Windows binary version of OpenSSL from
    http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
  * TODO: Check whether the version from msysDTK works as well. If it does,
    the Makefile and configure script should be adapted, because they assume
    that --with-openssl is set (which may not be necessary)
- Expat
  * Download, configure, and install  the source from 
    http://expat.sourceforge.net/
    The binary package will not do.

Building
--------
- Configure the build
    ./configure --with-expat=/path/to/expat --with-openssl=/path/to/openssl
- Run 'make', watch it fail (until this gets fixed)
- go to src/Swift, run 'make'
